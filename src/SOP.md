# DM North Standard Operating Procedure
## Version 1.0

## Introduction

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the organizational structure and management guidelines for storage and server equipment within our shared co-working environment. As Digital Missions (DM) operates within the Closed-Loop industrial automation facility, proper organization of equipment is essential to maintain operational efficiency, ensure clarity of ownership, and facilitate easy access to resources.

The purpose of this document is to establish a standardized approach to the organization of storage racks and server infrastructure, clearly delineating between permanent and transitional DM assets and Closed-Loop equipment. This SOP will serve as a reference guide for all team members to understand the designated locations of hardware and the rationale behind the organizational structure.

## Equipment Organization Overview

Our co-working space contains the following major organizational elements:

### Storage Racks
- DM (Permanent): Reserved for long-term Digital Missions equipment
- DM (Transit) #1: For temporary Digital Missions equipment in transition
- DM (Transit) #2: Additional space for temporary Digital Missions equipment
- Closed-Loop: Storage dedicated to Closed-Loop equipment

### Server Racks
- Closed-Loop #1: Contains Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro and H3C switch
- Closed-Loop #2: Reserved for Closed-Loop server equipment
- DM: Dedicated to Digital Missions server equipment
